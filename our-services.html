      <h3>All Our Services Are at NO CHARGE!</h3>
      <p><strong>We Pick Up end-of-life, damaged and unused Electronics.</strong> There is never a charge for our service. We pick up from businesses and residences. From Sarasota County up to Polk and Pasco County. We also have a network we work closely with to reach most of the United States.</p>
      <p><strong>We Destroy your Data.</strong> We shred all hard drives and other data storage media. We donâ€™t want to take a chance on your security. You can be sure your data is destroyed and nonrecoverable after Urban E Recycling handles it.</p>
      <p><strong>Certification.</strong> Once all your material has been processed, we will provide you with a Certificate of Recycling and/or Data Destruction depending on the services you requested. Just make sure we have a good e-mail address for you, and you will receive your certificates within 2-3 business days in most cases.</p>
